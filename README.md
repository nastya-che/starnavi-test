This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


I've used following technologies: Axios, Material UI, FlexBox, CSSGrid.

You can find DEMO <a href="https://nastya-che.github.io/starnavi-test/"> here <a/>;

There are two tabs with configurations based on Live and Demo APIs. In this 
particular way child elements will be displayed if they are presented as in 
demo API (since example with child elements was not presented in live API, 
I decided to keep it as in test one).
